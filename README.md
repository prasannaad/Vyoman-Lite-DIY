## What are PM Monitors?

Particulate matter (PM) monitors are devices designed to measure and monitor the concentration of airborne particles in the atmosphere. 
These particles can vary in size and composition and are categorized based on their diameter. Common classifications include PM10 (particles with a diameter of 10 micrometers or smaller) 
and PM2.5 (particles with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or smaller).

Particulate matter monitors are essential tools for environmental monitoring, air quality assessment, and public health studies. They help authorities and researchers understand the levels of 
particulate matter in the air, identify pollution sources and assess the potential health risks associated with exposure to these particles.
