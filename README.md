Make your basic PM monitor!
The Vyoman PM Lite is a complete set of modular & simple device aiming to provide tools for environmental monitoring, ranging from citizen science and educational activities to more advanced scientific research. 



## What are PM Monitors?

Particulate matter (PM) monitors are devices designed to measure and monitor the concentration of airborne particles in the atmosphere. 
These particles can vary in size and composition and are categorized based on their diameter. Common classifications include PM10 (particles with a diameter of 10 micrometers or smaller) 
and PM2.5 (particles with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or smaller).

Particulate matter monitors are essential tools for environmental monitoring, air quality assessment, and public health studies. They help authorities and researchers understand the levels of 
particulate matter in the air, identify pollution sources and assess the potential health risks associated with exposure to these particles.

## The Sensor

Low-cost particulate matter (PM) light scattering sensors typically operate on the principle of light scattering. These sensors leverage the fact that when particles in the air pass through a light source, such as a laser beam, they scatter light in different directions. By measuring the intensity of the scattered light, the sensor can estimate the concentration and size distribution of particulate matter in the air. Here's a simplified explanation of how these sensors work:

1. **Light Source:** The sensor typically includes a light source, often a laser diode, that emits a beam of light.

2. **Particle Interaction:** As air with suspended particles passes through the sensor, some of the particles intercept the light beam.

3. **Scattered Light:** When a particle intercepts the light, it scatters the light in various directions. The scattering pattern depends on the size and properties of the particle.

4. **Detection:** The sensor includes a detector that captures the scattered light. The detector measures the intensity of the scattered light at different angles.

5. **Data Processing:** The sensor processes the data, analyzing the scattering pattern and intensity to estimate the concentration and size of the particles. Algorithms are often employed to convert the scattering information into particulate matter measurements.

It's important to note that while low-cost PM sensors based on light scattering are valuable for providing real-time or near-real-time information about air quality, they may have limitations compared to more sophisticated and expensive instruments. Factors such as cross-sensitivity to different particle types, sensitivity to environmental conditions, and calibration issues may affect their accuracy. Therefore, they are often used in applications where cost and real-time data are prioritized over absolute precision, such as citizen science projects, educational activities, and initial air quality assessments.
